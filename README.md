Programming Language Converter for Javascript

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/fcwJueC.png)

**s2sc** (*Source to Source Converter*) is a javascript code convertion framework
that aims to connect other programming languages to web browsers by interpreting
codes from a programming language then converting it to another programming language.

At this moment, s2sc supports the following code conversions:
	Python -> C (Progress)

How to use
===========

By calling out s2sc.convert() will instruct s2sc to generate an equivalent code from
another language base on the source language that was given to it. The *convert function*
has 3 parameters, the first one specifies the *source language*, while the second specifies
the *target language* and the third parameter is the string of the source code. It can be called
directly and be used by other functions since the result of the *convert function* is just a string
that can be manipulated directly by other applications.

```javascript
s2sc.convert(s2sc.language.python2, s2sc.language.c, "a = 5 ** 23 + 5 ** 2 + pow(3+3434, 4)")
```

```C
/*******************************************************
		Code generated by s2sc.js
*******************************************************/

#include <tgmath.h>


int main (void) {

	double a = pow(5 , 23) + pow(5 , 2) + pow(3 + 3434 , 4);
	return 0;
}
```

Examples
===========
```Python

def add(a, b):
	return a + b

def main():
	c = add(445, 444)
	a = pow(2, c)
```
